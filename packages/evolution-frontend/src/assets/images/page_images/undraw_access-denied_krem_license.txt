License
Read below for the actual license but the gist is that you can use the illustrations in any project, commercial or personal without attribution or any costs. Just donâ€™t try to replicate unDraw, use for machine learning, redistribute in packs the illustrations or create integrations for it.

a rule of thumb (tldr)
If you are working on something and want to use illustrations to improve its appearance, modified or not, without the need for attribution or cost, you are good to go. If you find unDraw or its illustrations to be in the center of what you are doing (e.g. sell or re-distribute one/some of them, train an ai model, add them in an app), then you probably should not proceed.
