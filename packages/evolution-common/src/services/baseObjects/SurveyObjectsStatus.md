# OD Nationale Quebec Survey - Missing Attributes Analysis (Corrected)

This document compares all the data paths and attributes used in the OD Nationale Quebec survey, which will become the demo survey, with the **current objects** available in the Evolution platform (Interview, Household, Person, Journey, VisitedPlace, Trip, Segment, etc.). Base objects are deprecated and not considered in this analysis.

This file has been generated by Anthropic Claude 4 Sonnet and will be updated when attributes are migrated to the survey objects when needed.

This analysis provides a roadmap for extending the Evolution platform's audit capabilities to fully support the OD Nationale Quebec survey structure.
