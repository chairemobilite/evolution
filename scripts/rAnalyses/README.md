This directory contains `R` scripts that can be run on various evolution data.

## How to use

These scripts are not standalone scripts that can 'just' be run to get some data. They are provided to help data and metadata analyses of evolution-based survey results. They may not apply to any data, they may get outdated.

It is commented `Rmd` data, where each code block explains what it does. Each script can be downloaded independently or copied and fine-tuned to everyone's need.

## Pre-requisite

These scripts require a working version of `R` on your system. You may [install `R` in vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r) or use [`RStudio`](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) for that.

Some `R` packages are also required by the scripts:

* dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation
* ggplot2: Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics
* tidyr: Tidy Messy Data
* stringr
