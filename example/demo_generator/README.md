# Demo Generator: Household Travel Survey

This directory is a demo of a household travel survey. It showcases the capabilities of the Evolution-Generator.

Most of the files in this directory (but not all) are generated using the Evolution-Generator. The generator creates configurations for the questionnaire, including sections, widgets, and labels.

## Evolution-Generator Documentation

You can see the documentation for the Evolution-Generator [here](../../packages/evolution-generator/README.md).

## How to Run

To generate the files, run the following command from the root of the `evolution` project:

```bash
yarn generateSurvey:example
```
