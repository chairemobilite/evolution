Section: Perceptions

I am concerned about environmental and climate issues

I don't really see why I should change my habits when new technologies like electric cars will solve environmental problems

Globally, the use of private cars has negative consequences (ex.: on the environment, on the climate, on population's health, on the quality of living environment).

It's important for me to minimise the environmental footprint of my journeys

Save and continue



Section: Perceptions

Finally, we would like to know your opinion on various solutions that can address mobility challenges, as well as what you would like to do personally

I'm in favour of policies, regulations and planning that restrict the level of car traffic on our roads

Motorists should pay more (in parking, taxes, etc.) because of the negative impacts of car use on the environment and on communities (GHG emissions, congestion, public finances, health, etc.)

Our leaders should stop waging war on cars

Companies like the one I work for should put in place facilities and measures to encourage us to use public and active transport

Everyone should do their bit by using private cars less

It would be a good idea to reduce the space on the street dedicated to cars (traffic lanes, parking) to leave more space for active modes and public transport (bike lanes, wider sidewalks, reserved lanes for buses and carpooling)

In our neighbourhoods, I am in favour of measures such as reducing the maximum speed and adding speed bumps or curb extensions

Adding lanes or building new roads would reduce congestion

Section: Perceptions

Complete the sentence by indicating how much you agree with the following statements about your intentions in the coming months. In the future, I intend ...

... discuss the benefits of active transport (walking, cycling, etc.) with friends, colleagues and family

... publicly demonstrate (e.g. on social networks, at meetings, etc.) my support for initiatives that promote the use of alternative modes of transport to the car (e.g. new cycle infrastructure, protected bus lanes)

... buy a subscription to public transport, bixi or a car-sharing service

... attend a meeting of my borough or city council to discuss mobility issues or propose solutions
